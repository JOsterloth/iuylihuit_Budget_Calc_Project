Files that need to be improved:
start_interface.html // handles initial data collection / gets desired budget amounts
                     // later add method of switching between start_interface and purchase_interface via button(?)

Files that need to be made:
purchase_interface.html // handles user input for purchases, sends inputs to database?
budget_calc.php   // contains methods used to calculate budget
budget_index.php  // gets user input from both purchase_interface.html and start_interface.html
budget_view.php   // used to show current purchases and amount of budgeted cash spent,
this file will be visited after each purchase.
budget_report.php // Uses file read and write to generate a report on budget
